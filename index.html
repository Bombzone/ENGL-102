                        <h5>The Big Picture of the Climate</h5>
                        <p>There are many views on the climate problem, however many people look at the celebrities and
                            the
                            rich as the source of the problem. Taylor Swift is a big contributor to this, however there
                            is a
                            good reason. Even though celebrities and the rich may be a big contributor to the problem,
                            you
                            should look at the big picture.</p>
                        <p>In August of 2022 there was a record-breaking heatwave. During
                            this people on Twitter were posting hate comments about Taylor Swift and her contribution to
                            the
                            climate issue. These negative contributions being discussed were from her private jet’s
                            emissions of
                            CO2. Around this time a research organization made a report on celebrities and their carbon
                            footprint due to flights. This report showed Taylor Swift as the number one contributor.
                            This
                            report
                            however used flight logs that showed the planes total usage, including other people
                            borrowing
                            her
                            jet. Her plane was estimated to have emitted over 8,000 metric tons of CO2 in only 7 months
                            .</p>
                        <p>Other than the obvious purpose of gaining views by starting the video essay with a
                            discussion about Taylor Swift, a topic that would attract viewers that both love and hate
                            her,
                            this
                            video offers the very questionable defense on Taylor Swift’s behalf. This defense states
                            “Taylor
                            Swift isn’t the worst person on the planet regarding climate change.” While this sort of
                            deflection
                            offers a defense, it does not address the hypocrisy of Taylor Swift’s jet usage.</p>
                        <p>Of course, a bad
                            defense for Taylor Swift is not proof that she is in the wrong. The estimated amount of over
                            8,000
                            metric tons of CO2 from 7 months of flying may be 39 times that of the average CO2 emissions
                            of
                            an
                            United States citizen , but Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour sold over 10 million tickets (Just
                            Jared). If everyone that went to the concerts had to fly 1000 kilometers on average to
                            Taylor
                            Swift
                            instead of her flying to them that would make over two million metric tons of CO2 (Our World
                            in
                            Data). Taylor Swift is just doing her job, and that job is to entertain millions of people a
                            year.</p>
                        <p>According to Our Changing Climate, there was also an Oxfam report discussing the
                            correlation between household income and carbon emissions. This study showed that the
                            richest 1%
                            has
                            double the carbon emissions than the poorest 50% in the world. Also, according to Our
                            Changing
                            Climate, this is not what we should be worried about. Instead, we should be worried about
                            the
                            companies that provide carbon emitting resources .<br>
                        <p>This is not the way to the solution. One
                            of the only ways to reduce carbon emissions dramatically is for the government to step in
                            and
                            raise
                            taxes, however the US is already doing this (Peter G. Peterson Foundation). Another way to
                            reduce
                            carbon emissions is the people use less carbon emitting resources globally. This means
                            everyone
                            doing their part to help decrease global carbon emissions.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the poor are less to blame
                            per person than the rich are to blame per person, but you must look at the bigger picture if
                            you
                            are
                            to understand the climate issue. Just looking at the average of the two groups the rich are
                            to
                            blame, but changing their ways will not fix this problem. The only way to make a lasting
                            difference
                            is to change the ways of the many, not the few.</p>

                        <p>Brett Cadaro states in his article, “The cel-shaded graphical style introduced in Wind Waker
                            is
                            so timeless that it would even go on to inform the one used in BOTW and TOTK” (Cardaro).
                            It’s
                            been nearly 40 years since the release of The Legend of Zelda and over 20 games have been
                            released in the series. Each game in this series has maximized the capabilities of its
                            console.
                            For example, The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask even needed an expansion to the Nintendo 64
                            system. Not only do The Legend of Zelda games maximize the capabilities of the console they
                            are
                            released on, but they also often bring new concepts. This brings up a very controversial
                            topic
                            of which is the best.</p>
                        <p>In the article Twilight Princess Is Great, but the Wind Waker Is a Masterpiece, Cardaro
                            discusses
                            many similarities and differences between the two Legend of Zelda games released for the
                            Nintendo GameCube. In addition to comparing these two games, the article praises these games
                            and
                            calls The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker a “masterpiece.” To compare the two games, Cardaro
                            discusses the design, story, and characters in each game. As introduced by Cardaro, The Wind
                            Waker is a game with a cartoon design while Twilight Princess is a game with more realistic
                            visuals. The Wind Waker has more emotion than its counterpart. Twilight Princess has a
                            gloomier
                            tone. The Wind Waker shaped the latest Legend of Zelda games by having an open world feel.
                            In
                            the end, Cardaro is trying to convince his readers that Wind Waker is the better Legend of
                            Zelda
                            game (Cardaro).</p>
                        <p>In the video Twilight Princess VS The Wind Waker, the YouTuber Hud talks about which game is
                            better in a few distinct categories. The first category he discusses is dungeons. For each
                            dungeon he discusses what he likes and dislikes and gives it a score out of 10. For this
                            category he says Twilight Princess is better. He then discusses exploration within each
                            game. He
                            says The Wind Waker is better in this category. His final category he discusses is the
                            story.
                            There are many things that he likes and dislikes in each game, however Hud decides that he
                            likes
                            Twilight Princess’s story better (Hud).</>
                        <p>Cardaro claimed that The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is better than The Legend of Zelda:
                            Twilight Princess while Hud claimed that The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is better.
                            One
                            of Cardaro’s main points was how The Wind Waker brought new concepts to The Legend of Zelda
                            series. Another argument as to why The Wind Waker was a better game is how it made an
                            impression
                            on future games.</p>
                        <p>Hud’s argument was supported by discussing which was a better game rather than focusing on
                            which
                            one had a greater influence on the rest of the series. Hud, however, has a flaw in his
                            video. He
                            states that he will not be talking about the game’s combat mechanics however he ends the
                            video
                            by saying that combat in Twilight Princess is better.</p>
                        <p>Hud’s argument was the better way to decide what game is better, however he didn’t have very
                            good
                            supporting details. This is why Cardaro has the more effective argument. I think that the
                            better
                            game is The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. The ranking of Legend of Zelda games,
                            however,
                            is a very controversial topic.</p>
